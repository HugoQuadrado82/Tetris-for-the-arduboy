# Tetris-for-the-arduboy
A classic clone of tetris for the arduboy

So, its not quite finished yet. I need to do a few things more just to improve the look and feel of the game
I've always liked the song so i made sure that I included it.
 As of now, the game has little menu graphics or text but is still playable!

-Russian music!  
-Blocks!  
-Scores!  
-Tetris!  
-Competition Map size (for all those nerds that that matters to lol)  

(make sure you flip the arduboy 90 degrees)
UP : rotate piece
LEFT/RIGHT : move to the left or right
DOWN : speed up the dropping time
A BUTTON : pause the game, start the game

To Do:
-I'm going to comment the whole thing up and down
-Adding graphics and text to the main menu and lose menu
-Going to make the B button show the next piece
-mess around with getting better music if possible
-make a high score system
-Any suggestions?
