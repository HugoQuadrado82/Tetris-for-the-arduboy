# Tetris-for-the-arduboy
A classic clone of tetris for the arduboy

So, its not quite finished yet. I need to clean the code up some and add or subrtract a few things but I thought I'd go ahead and post what I have so far of this tetris clone!
I've always liked the song so i made sure that I included it.
 As of now, the game has no menu graphics or text, and has a few bugs that I am working out right now. (I'll let you find them for yourself ;D)

-Russian music!
-Blocks!
-Scores!
-Tetris!

(make sure you flip the arduboy 90 degrees)
UP : rotate piece
LEFT/RIGHT : move to the left or right
DOWN : speed up the dropping time
A BUTTON : pause the game

To Do:
-I'm going to comment the whole thing up and down
-Adding graphics and text to the main menu, pause menu, and the board itself
-Going to make the B button show the next piece
-mess around with getting better music if possible
-make a high score system
-Any suggestions?
